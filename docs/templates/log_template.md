## ðŸ¤– GPT Agent Instructions

When logging work:

1. Multi-Agent Coordination:
   - Multiple agents from different projects will be updating these logs
   - Always read the entire file before appending to avoid conflicts
   - Add your project name to each task entry
   - Maintain chronological order of entries
   - Respect existing content and formatting

2. Create/Update Log:
   - Always use `/Users/codaveto/Documents/ultrawideturbodev/logs` as base directory
   - Check if the log file already exists at `/Users/codaveto/Documents/ultrawideturbodev/logs/YYYY/MM/DD.md`
   - If it exists:
     - Read the entire file first
     - Append your entry while maintaining chronological order
     - Preserve existing entries and formatting
   - If not:
     - Create necessary directories and the log file
     - Initialize with this template
   - Use descriptive task titles with project name
   - Add relevant tags (#feature, #bug, #meeting, etc.)

3. For Each Task Entry:

   - Document what was actually done
   - Explain how it was implemented
   - Note why certain decisions were made
   - Include all relevant links (PRs, docs, etc.)

       - Cool UI animations
       - Before/after improvements
       - Interesting visualizations
       - Impressive features
